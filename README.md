# BigChainCryptoProfile
Java Application POC for a Blockchain Database 

This project is an implementation of BigChainDB (www.bigchaindb.com) blockchain database's libraries. BigchainDB allows developers and enterprise to deploy blockchain proof-of-concepts, platforms and applications with a blockchain database, supporting a wide range of industries and use cases.

This POC attempts to leverage BigChainDB's java libraries to build a simple application that allows to add an individual's credentials (education, job etc.) into a blockchain based storage.

Java libraries used in this POC are version 1.2. Please checkout BigChainDB's website for latest versions.

Please checkout my another repository CryptoProfile for more flushed out project on the same concepts but with more features such as Searching a Blockchain based Profile, Adding more blocks to an existing Profile etc. in addition to Creating a Blockchain based Profile
